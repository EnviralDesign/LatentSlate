## 🤔 What's This?

**NLA AI Video Creator** is an open-source desktop app that bridges the gap between AI generation tools and video editing. If you've ever found yourself:

- Juggling between ComfyUI, file explorers, and video editors
- Manually renaming and organizing generated assets
- Wishing you could see your AI-generated clips on a timeline *with* your audio
- Wanting to iterate on generations without losing your creative flow

...then this project is for you.

### The Vision

A purpose-built timeline editor where:

- 🎵 **Audio, images, and video live together** — See your soundtrack alongside AI-generated visuals
- 🔌 **ComfyUI is a first-class citizen** — Connect your local workflows directly to the editor
- 🧠 **Generation happens in-context** — Select a clip, tweak parameters, hit generate, see results
- 💾 **Everything stays local** — Your projects, your machine, your data

> **Philosophy:** This isn't trying to replace Premiere or DaVinci. It's the missing link between "I have cool AI workflows" and "I have a finished video."

## 🚧 Current Status

**⚠️ Active Development — Not Production Ready**

This is a passion project in early stages. Things work, things break, APIs change. If you're looking for a polished tool to use *today*, check back later!

**If you're here to:**
- ⭐ Watch the project evolve
- 🛠️ Contribute code or ideas
- 🧪 Experiment with early builds

...you're in the right place. Star the repo to follow along!

### What Works Today

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Timeline with tracks (video/audio/markers) | ✅ |
| Drag, resize, and manage clips | ✅ |
| Timeline preview with transforms | ✅ |
| ComfyUI workflow integration (image gen) | ✅ |
| Generative assets with version history | ✅ |
| Provider Builder UI (no JSON editing required) | ✅ |
| Project save/load | ✅ |

### What's Coming

- [ ] Audio playback & waveform visualization
- [ ] Video generation workflow support (backend mostly complete)
- [ ] Smart input suggestions (timeline as implicit wiring)
- [ ] More provider adapters (fal.ai, Replicate, etc.)
- [ ] Export to video file
- [ ] macOS & Linux builds

See the full roadmap in [docs/PROJECT.md](./docs/PROJECT.md).

## 🔌 ComfyUI Integration

This is where things get interesting. **Bring Your Own Workflow™** — your ComfyUI setups become first-class providers in the editor.

### How It Works

1. **Point the app at your local ComfyUI** instance
2. **Use the Provider Builder** to select which workflow inputs to expose (prompts, seeds, steps, CFG, etc.)
3. **Bind parameters** via a visual node browser — no JSON editing required
4. **Generate directly from the timeline** — results land in your project with version history

No vendor lock-in. No cloud dependency. Your workflows, your way.

### Why This Matters

ComfyUI has become the power-user's playground for AI image and video generation. But it's a *workflow tool*, not an *editing tool*. This project aims to be the bridge — letting you orchestrate your ComfyUI outputs in a timeline-based environment without leaving your creative flow.

The provider system is designed to be extensible. ComfyUI is the first adapter, but the architecture supports:
- Custom HTTP endpoints
- Commercial APIs (fal.ai, Replicate, etc.) — planned
- Any backend that can accept parameters and return media

## ⚙️ Under the Hood

For the developers curious about what makes this tick — the preview and compositing pipeline is where we've invested significant effort. Here's the architecture:

### 🎞️ Preview Pipeline

The challenge: the editor needs responsive timeline preview, media decoding, and UI overlays in one native desktop window. The current shell uses egui/eframe so dialogs, panels, timeline controls, and preview output are composed in the same UI stack.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     Preview Pipeline                            │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                 │
│  ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐   │
│  │   FFmpeg     │    │    Frame     │    │   egui Preview   │   │
│  │   Decode     │── ▶│    Cache     │──▶│   Texture Path    │   │
│  │   Workers    │    │   (LRU)      │    │                  │   │
│  └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └──────────────────┘   │
│         │                   │                     │             │
│         ▼                   ▼                     ▼             │
│   • In-process decode   • 8GB budget         • Layer stacking   │
│   • HW accel (D3D11VA)  • Prefetch window    • Per-clip xforms  │
│   • Parallel workers    • Latest-wins        • GPU compositing  │
│   • CPU fallback        • Per-asset keying   • Native window   │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Three key components:**

1. **FFmpeg Decode Workers** — In-process video decoding via `ffmpeg-next`. Supports hardware acceleration on Windows (D3D11VA/DXVA2) with automatic CPU fallback. Parallel decode workers keyed by track to avoid decoder contention.

2. **Frame Cache** — LRU cache with an 8GB budget for smooth scrubbing. Prefetch windows (5s ahead, 1s behind) warm the cache when idle. Latest-wins scheduling cancels stale decode jobs when you scrub quickly — only the frames you need get decoded.

3. **egui Preview Texture Path** — Preview frames are rendered into an egui texture inside the native UI. This keeps overlays, modals, and editor controls in the same composition layer while we rebuild the deeper preview compositor.

### 📊 Diagnostic Tools

We built in visibility for optimization work:
- **Preview stats overlay** with per-stage timing (seek, decode, transfer, scale, upload)
- **Hardware decode percentage** — see how much is offloaded to the GPU
- **Cache hit rate** tracking — know when you're hitting vs. missing
- **HW Dec toggle** — force CPU decode for A/B comparisons

> **Work in Progress:** We're still optimizing. The GPU currently receives RGBA after CPU conversion — a future path keeps YUV/NV12 on the GPU to avoid the round-trip. There's headroom to improve.
